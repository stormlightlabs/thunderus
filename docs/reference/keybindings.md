# Keybindings

Thunderus keybindings are evolving with the TUI integration. The list below
reflects the shortcuts currently surfaced in the UI tips. Treat this page as a
baseline, not an exhaustive map.

## Tips

- `Ctrl+S`: Toggle the sidebar.
- `Tab`: Autocomplete file paths.
- `Ctrl+T`: Toggle the color theme.
- `!cmd`: Run a shell command directly.
- `Ctrl+Shift+G`: Open an external editor.

## Additional Bindings

The TUI may surface additional bindings in-context. Use the in-app hints and
help overlays for the most current list.
