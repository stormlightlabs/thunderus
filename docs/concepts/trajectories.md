# Trajectories & Inspector

Trajectories capture "why" a decision was made: they link memory entries and
conclusions back to the evidence in the event log and diff history.

## What a Trajectory Provides

- A chronological trace of relevant events.
- Links to the patches or file changes that influenced a decision.
- A place to surface confidence and risk classification.

## Planned: Interactive Inspector

The inspector UI is designed to make trajectories interactive: filtering by tool
usage, jumping to diffs, and drilling into the evidence chain. The UI state exists,
but end-to-end integration remains **Planned**.
